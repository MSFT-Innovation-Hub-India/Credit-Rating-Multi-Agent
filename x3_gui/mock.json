With a 13% year-over-year revenue drop and no clear profitability, the firm relies heavily on debt financing, reflected in its high estimated debt-to-equity ratio of 4.17. Despite ongoing restructuring efforts and significant capital investments, free cash flow remains negative, and adjusted EBITDA is deeply in the red. Liquidity concerns persist, and the company is dependent on refinancing and asset-backed securities to maintain operations. Its financial instability and negative margins suggest heightened credit risk in the near term."

The declining revenues, negative free cash flow, and deeply negative EBITDA indicate severe financial instability. The high debt-to-equity ratio of 4.17 raises concerns about the company's ability to meet its financial obligations. The reliance on debt financing, ongoing restructuring efforts, and liquidity concerns further amplify the risk of financial fraud. It is recommended to conduct a thorough investigation into the company's financial statements, operations, and management practices to uncover any potential fraudulent activities.",
