Risk Factor Assessment for Granting Credit:  
Based on the available data, Microsoft exhibits very strong profitability and cash flow generation as well as substantial liquidity. The absence of total assets and liabilities data prevents a full assessment of leverage, but the cash position and operational results suggest a low credit risk and a high capacity to meet short-term and long-term obligations.
