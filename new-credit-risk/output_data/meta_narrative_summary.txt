Across the multiple financial summaries for Microsoft Corporation for the period ending March 31, 2024, the company demonstrates robust financial health, underscored by strong revenue growth, high profitability, substantial liquidity, and prudent balance sheet management. Revenue increased by approximately 17% year-over-year, exceeding $180 billion for the nine months and reaching $61.9 billion in the third quarter alone. Net income for the same nine-month period was a remarkable $66.1 billion, translating to a notable increase in both earnings per share (basic EPS of $8.90 and diluted EPS of $8.85), and quarterly EPS at $2.94, reflecting operational leverage and effective cost control.

Microsoft maintains a large asset base ($484.3 billion in total assets versus $231.1 billion in liabilities), and shareholders’ equity remains strong at $253.2 billion, underpinning the company’s solvency. The cash and cash equivalents position, though still significant at $19.6 billion, has decreased compared to the prior period due to a combination of high capital expenditures ($14 billion in Q3, primarily for cloud and AI infrastructure), aggressive investment and acquisition activity (notably the Activision Blizzard acquisition), and substantial returns to shareholders ($29.2 billion in buybacks and dividends year-to-date).

Despite the outsized investment and financing outflows—outpacing even the impressive operational inflows—Microsoft’s liquidity remains ample with $80 billion in combined cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and a cash flow from operations of over $31.9 billion in the quarter ($81.4 billion for nine months). Gross and operating margins remain high (70% and 45% respectively), with cloud revenue and profitability showing strong double-digit gains.

All four reports support a consensus on Microsoft’s low credit risk: the powerful combination of strong free cash flow, disciplined capital allocation, resilient operating margins, and a diversified and growing backlog of future commercial obligations ($235 billion) presents little immediate concern from a credit or fraud risk perspective. The only minor inconsistencies relate to the periodicity and presentation of certain metrics (annualized, quarterly, nine-month figures), though none materially alter the assessment of the company’s underlying strength. In summary, Microsoft’s financial position is highly secure, with strong cash generation capacity, formidable balance sheet strength, and scalable profitability—even amid elevated investment and acquisition activity.
