  "summary": "TerraDrive Mobility Corp. is a struggling mobility services company currently operating at a loss and experiencing declining revenues. With a 13% year-over-year revenue drop and no clear profitability, the firm relies heavily on debt financing, reflected in its high estimated debt-to-equity ratio of 4.17. Despite ongoing restructuring efforts and significant capital investments, free cash flow remains negative, and adjusted EBITDA is deeply in the red. Liquidity concerns persist, and the company is dependent on refinancing and asset-backed securities to maintain operations. Its financial instability and negative margins suggest heightened credit risk in the near term."
