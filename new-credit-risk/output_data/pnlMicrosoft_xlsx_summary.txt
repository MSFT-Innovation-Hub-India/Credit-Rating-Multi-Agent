Risk Factor Assessment for Granting Credit:  
Based on the available financial data, the company shows robust profitability and revenue growth, supporting a positive view of its creditworthiness. However, the absence of balance sheet details (total assets, liabilities, equity, and cash positions) means a full assessment of liquidity and leverage cannot be completed. For a comprehensive credit risk evaluation, acquisition of the latest balance sheet figures is recommended.
